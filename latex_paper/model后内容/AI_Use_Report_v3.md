1.  **ChatGPT 5.2 Thinking (Jan 30, 2026 version, OpenAI)**\
    **Query1:** What is the working principle of lithium-ion batteries
    in smartphones?\
    **Output:**
    1)  Lithium-ion batteries operate based on reversible
        electrochemical reactions involving lithium-ion intercalation
        between two electrodes.\
    2)  During discharge, lithium ions move from the anode (typically
        graphite) to the cathode through the electrolyte, while
        electrons flow through the external circuit to power the
        smartphone.\
    3)  During charging, an external voltage drives lithium ions back
        from the cathode to the anode, restoring stored energy.\
    4)  A separator prevents electrical short circuits between
        electrodes while allowing ion transport, ensuring safety and
        stable operation.
2.  **ChatGPT 5.2 Thinking (Jan 31, 2026 version, OpenAI)**\
    **Query2:** How does ambient temperature affect lithium-ion battery
    discharge in smartphones?\
    **Output:**
    1)  Ambient temperature influences lithium-ion battery discharge by
        affecting internal resistance and electrochemical reaction
        kinetics.\
    2)  At low temperatures, reduced ion mobility and slower
        charge-transfer reactions increase polarization, resulting in
        lower discharge voltage and reduced usable capacity.\
    3)  At moderately high temperatures, discharge performance may
        temporarily improve due to enhanced reaction rates.\
    4)  Excessively high temperatures accelerate side reactions and
        battery aging, which degrades long-term discharge performance
        and lifespan.
3.  **ChatGPT 5.2 Thinking (Feb 2, 2026 version, OpenAI)**\
    **Query3:** How can algorithms for continuous-time Markov chains be
    optimized?\
    **Output:**
    1)  Optimizing continuous-time Markov chain algorithms focuses on
        improving computational efficiency in state transitions and
        probability evaluation.\
    2)  State-space reduction techniques, such as aggregation or
        truncation, can reduce computational complexity while preserving
        essential system behavior.\
    3)  Uniformization methods can convert continuous-time Markov chains
        into equivalent discrete-time chains for easier numerical
        computation.\
    4)  Sparse matrix representations and optimized numerical solvers
        can accelerate matrix exponentiation and steady-state
        probability calculations.
4.  **ChatGPT 5.2 Thinking (Feb 2, 2026 version, OpenAI)**\
    **Query4:** How many key elements need to be determined when drawing
    a flowchart?\
    **Output:**
    1)  The assistant explained that the process steps or actions must
        first be clearly identified to represent the logical sequence of
        the workflow.\
    2)  Decision points should be determined to show where different
        conditions lead to branching paths in the process.\
    3)  Inputs and outputs need to be specified to clarify what
        information or materials enter and exit each stage.\
    4)  Start and end points must be defined to clearly indicate the
        boundaries and overall structure of the flowchart.
